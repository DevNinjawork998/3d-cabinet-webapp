/**
 * Talk to GDEX without the app in the way.
 *
 * The adapter in `lib/logistics/adapters/gdex.ts` is a stub, so there is no
 * fixture to compare against yet — this script is how the real request and
 * reply shapes get established before any of it is written down.
 *
 *   node --env-file=.env.local scripts/gdex-ping.mjs
 *   pnpm gdex:ping
 *
 * It reads only: the token's validity, the e-wallet balance, and a shipping
 * rate for a small parcel between two real Klang Valley postcodes. It never
 * creates a consignment — that spends credit.
 *
 * Auth is two separate credentials, and confusing them is the whole reason this
 * script exists:
 *
 * - `subscription-key` — the Azure APIM key from the developer portal. GDEX
 *   renamed APIM's default header, so `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` is silently
 *   ignored and the gateway answers "missing subscription key" while you are
 *   busy sending one. Primary and secondary are interchangeable; secondary is
 *   the rotation spare, not a signing secret.
 * - `User-Token` — the Integration Token from the myGDEX *web application*
 *   (User Profile), a different system from the developer portal. This is the
 *   one that says which GDEX account is being billed.
 *
 * The two environments are the same host, split by a `/test` path segment, and
 * a key is only valid for the product it was issued against — a Testing key on
 * the live path returns "invalid subscription key", which reads like a bad key
 * and is not.
